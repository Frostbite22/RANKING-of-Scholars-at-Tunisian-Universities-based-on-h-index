Scientists always need to locate their position in the research landscape of their community so that they can assess their career and envision future directions for their work by seeing what their peers are doing. Tunisian scientists are not an exception to this rule. In this context, several bibliometric studies have been conducted to identify the main local scientists and trends in various research fields in Tunisia, particularly Chemistry [1], Infectious Diseases [2], Community Health [3], General Surgery [4], and so on. When robust measures allowing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of scientists, mainly h-index, have appeared since 2005 [5], a new trend of using such metrics to rank scientists has appeared allowing the generation of various rankings for scientists by discipline and country, especially in the developed nations [6]. In Tunisia, the first h-index ranking has been created in 2014 featuring local and expatriate scientists [7]. It was based on extracting all Tunisian surnames from the phone directory and then using Google Scholar to scrape all the names of scientists that are likely to be Tunisian citizens. The list is later filtered to include only highly-cited scientists (h-index >= 15) and then verified by hand to verify its accuracy. Despite the added value of this work, it mistakenly included several non-Tunisian scientists and discarded influential Tunisian scientists. A series of disciplinary rankings have been done later to solve this problem [8-9]. In 2017, a second generation of h-index rankings has appeared in Tunisia with the creation of a semi-automated ranking named *TunSci* [10]. This ranking adds influential scientists to an Excel spreadsheet by hand (h-index >= 20 for local scientists and h-index >= 30 for expatriate scientists). Then, the Excel spreadsheet is linked to the public Google Scholar profiles of these scientists using the Microsoft .NET Framework and subsequently used to automatically update the ranking on a regular basis by scraping Google Scholar. Although these works achieved a certain recognition, they had several limitations  that led to their interruption in 2019:
* Comparing scientists from different fields is not appreciated, particularly as several areas are more likely to be cited than other ones [11].
* Older scientists are more likely to achieve higher h-index than younger ones [12].

The h-index is an author-level metric that measures both the productivity and citation impact of the publications, initially used for an individual scientist or scholar. The h-index correlates with obvious success indicators such as winning the Nobel Prize, being accepted for research fellowships and holding positions at top universities.

## metrics 
What is a Good h-Index? Hirsch reckons that after 20 years of research, an h-index of 20 is good, 40 is outstanding, and 60 is truly exceptional.

## Scope 
This project is build by scraping the google scholars for Tunisian university. It contains 2130 scholars from different univerities, with different research fields and interests.

## Objective 
This project's intent is to refect the real impact and contribution of Tunisian universities on research in general and on the qualities of higher education in Tunisia.

## Significatant statistics 
Average h-index : 8.1

## Things to be done in this project ( contributions are welcomed )
#### Average h-index by research field ( most successful fields )
#### standard deviation from all authors ( we have many with zero publications ) 
#### number of scholars working on each field
